            <h1>Rayan Siddiq</h1>
            <h3>Author of Echoes of Midnight</h3>
<p>  Rayan Siddiq is a fiction writer whose stories explore silence,
        memory, and the shadows left behind by unresolved pasts. His
        narratives often blend suspense with emotional depth.</p>
        <p>
        <strong>Echoes of Midnight</strong> is a haunting novel that follows
        voices that surface after dark—forgotten truths, lingering regrets,
        and memories that refuse to stay buried.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through a moody atmosphere and layered storytelling, Rayan invites
        readers to confront the echoes that shape who we become when the
        world falls silent.
