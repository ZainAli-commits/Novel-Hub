            <h3>Author of Love Or????</h3>
<p>  Essa Rajpoot is an emerging fiction writer stepping 
    into the literary world with curiosity, ambition, and a deep passion for storytelling.
     His work explores love, ambition, power, and the emotional battles that shape human destiny.</p>
        <p>
        <strong>Love Or????</strong>marks his debut novel—a bold first step into a 
        world where relationships are tested,

        Through layered characters and dramatic tension, Essa invites 
        readers to reflect on the fragile line between love and pride, ambition and sacrifice, 
        illusion and truth. As he begins his journey as a storyteller, he aims not only to entertain but to grow, 
        experiment, and connect with readers who believe that every heart holds a story worth telling.
